# Key Components:
WordPress Deployment:

Containers: WordPress application container.
Persistent Storage: PersistentVolume (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) for storing WordPress data.
Service:
Internal Service: Exposing WordPress internally within the cluster for other services to interact with.
External Service: Exposing WordPress externally, often via a LoadBalancer or Ingress, to make it accessible from outside the cluster.
SQL (e.g., MySQL) Deployment:

Containers: SQL database container.
Persistent Storage: PV and PVC for database persistence.
Service:
Internal Service: Typically, an internal ClusterIP service is used to allow WordPress to connect to the database securely within the cluster.
Service Exposure:
Internal Service: Usually a ClusterIP service type, which is only accessible within the Kubernetes cluster. This is typically used for database services like MySQL to ensure secure communication.
External Service: Could be a NodePort, LoadBalancer, or Ingress service type to expose the WordPress application to the outside world. LoadBalancer or Ingress is preferred for handling HTTP/HTTPS traffic and providing a stable external IP or domain.
